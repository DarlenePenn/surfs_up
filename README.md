# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis is to look at historical weather data for different locations in Hawaii to determine which Island would be the best place to open a surf shop.  The investors are particularly concerned with the temperature and precipitation, which would heavily impact open business days, as heavy rain would deter customers from surfing and could even result in the surf shop having to close.

## Results
Results show there are 3 key differences in the weather between June and December: 
  - The average temperature in June was 74.9 degrees, while in December the average temperature drops to 71.0 degrees
  - The max temperature is not much higher in June (85 degrees) than it is in December (83 degrees). 
  - The minimum temperature is a pleasant 64 degrees in June, but dropws to 56 degrees in December. 

## Summary
From the data, it appears that this location would be a good business opportunity year-round.  During the summer months, as evidenced in June, the weather is an average temperature of 74 degrees, with little varition. In December, it is only a few degrees colder with a standard deviation of just 3.75, meaning we can expect pretty stable temperatures in both months.  I would recommend checking the precipation per month so see if there is a rainy season we need to be aware of and also, compare the precipitation at various stations during those months as well.
